    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      The goal of this project was to train reinforcement learning agents to play competitive Minecraft minigames.
      The agents learned to play the minigames by playing against each other, commonly referred to as self-play.
      Proximal policy optimization (PPO) was used for training.
    </p>
    <p>
      In total, three games were trained: Sumo, Classic Duels, and The Bridge. Each game was trained for 7 days.
      During the experiment, the agents played over 10 years worth of Minecraft.
